    	<p>Below are a few edits i've made to pictures of my favorite professional athletes. I used to post these to an instagram but no longer have the editing tools to continue to post.</p> 

   		<p><IMG SRC="edit1.jpg"></p> <p><IMG SRC="edit2.jpg"></p>

      	<p><IMG SRC="edit3.jpg"></p>

		<p>These three I printed and framed myself because I am a huge fan of the Indianapolis Colts, devoting every sunday to the NFL.
